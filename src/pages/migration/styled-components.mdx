[styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) is a CSS-IN-JS library that quickly attracted the React community with its laconic API.
If you are one of those, who use styled-components in your project, this guide is for you.

## Motivation

`Reshadow` allows us to combine the `css-in-js` and `css-modules` approach, so the migration for you will be as simple as possible.
However, reshadow`and`styled-components` API's are different, since the latter has several disadvantages:

-   Typings
-   Wrapper over the component, since the API `styled-components` is built on `HOC`
-   Control over the external and internal interface of the component
-   The inconvenience of mapping complex states
-   Only for `React`

## Migration Approaches

Migration can be divided into two approaches:

-   [Single](#single) - this is for you, if you don't want to rewrite the entire project immediately to reshadow
-   [Iterative](#iterative) - migration to reshadow, by gradually rewriting components

## Single

Reshadow has a compatible API with `styled-components`. You need to do the following:

-   install package `@reshadow/styled` with your favorite package manager
-   change imports from `styled-components` to `@reshadow/styled` with your favorite editor ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_search-and-replace), [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/tutorial-finding-and-replacing-text-using-regular-expressions.html#Tutorial_Finding_and_Replacing_Text_Using_Regular_Expressions.xml))

```js
import styled from 'styled-components';
// ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓
import styled from '@reshadow/styled';
```

As an example, you can look at a rewritten project from `styled-components` to `@reshadow/styled` - [winXP](https://github.com/ShizukuIchi/winXP/commit/dcc79422bb85b6f140c40ec9b43b9b42c3ec166a).

`@reshadow/styled` uses runtime styles, but still, it remains fast.
You can see examples in the talk at [React Russia](https://youtu.be/edcRISVmMxY?t=1738)

## Iterative

The `styled-components` remains a library, that uses the `css-in-js` approach, using `React` wrappers to apply styles to the component.
`reshadow` uses a slightly different approach, that allows you to write a semantically correct layout, without creating unnecessary wrappers around the component.

### Getting Started

First you need to install the package `reshadow`. Example with npm:

```bash
npm install --save reshadow
```

To configure `reshadow` in the project, use the instruction [Setup](/setup).

### Basic component

`styled-components` uses tagged template literals to style the component. `reshadow` also allows you to use the tagged template literal.

If you have configured [extracting styles](/setup#webpack), you can put styles into a separate `css` file.

`styled-components`

```js
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Button = styled.button`
    font-size: 16px;
    color: white;
    background: black;
    border: 1px solid;
    border-radius: 4px;
`;
```

`reshadow`

```jsx
import styled from 'reshadow';

// you can put styles in a separate file `style.css`
const Button = props => styled`
    button {
        font-size: 16px;
        color: white;
        background: black;
        border: 1px solid;
        border-radius: 4px;
    }
`(<button {...props} />);
```

### Mapping on component props

Consider the case, if you need to adapt to the component's props.

`styled-components`

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Button = styled.button`
    font-size: 16px;
    color: ${props => (props.primary ? 'black' : 'white')};
    background: ${props => (props.primary ? 'yellow' : 'black')};
    border: 1px solid;
    border-radius: 4px;
`;

const App = () => <Button primary>Click on me !</Button>;
```

`reshadow`

```jsx
import styled from 'reshadow';

// you can put styles in a separate file `style.css`
const Button = ({primary, ...props}) => styled`
    button {
        font-size: 16px;
        color: white;
        background: black;
        border: 1px solid;
        border-radius: 4px;
    }

    button[|primary] {
        background: yellow;
        color: black;
    }
`(<button use:primary={primary} {...props} />);

const App = () => <Button primary>Click on me !</Button>;
```

As you can see, the `button` uses the `use` namespace, it is used to define [modifiers](/concepts#props-and-modifiers).

### Dynamic Variables

If you need to map props to dynamic styles, you can write notation in `css-in-js`, see [Dynamic Variables](/usage/css-in-js#dynamic-variables).

`styled-components`

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Button = styled.button`
    font-size: 16px;
    color: ${props => props.color};
    background: black;
    border: 1px solid;
    border-radius: 4px;
`;
```

`reshadow`

```jsx
import styled from 'reshadow';

// you can't put styles in a separate file `style.css`, because it's using dynamic variables
const Button = ({color, ...props}) => styled`
    button {
        font-size: 16px;
        color: ${color};
        background: black;
        border: 1px solid;
        border-radius: 4px;
    }
`(<button {...props} />);
```

In the case of dynamic values, `styled-components` have a problem with style duplication - [Issue](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/1431#issuecomment-358097912).
Unpleasant problem, right?

`reshadow` has no such problem, because it uses static styles and `css-variables`.

[Counter Example](https://codesandbox.io/s/reshadow-counter-1ev7b) - try clicking on the button, and watch out for styles.
